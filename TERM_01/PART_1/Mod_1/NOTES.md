# Module 01: Welcome to the DS Nanodegree Program

## Lesson 01: Welcome to the DS Nanodegree Program
Learn about what you will build, meet your instructors, and learn how to be successful in the Data Scientist Nanodegree Program! Welcome!

### Concept 01: Welcome

* Reach people in unregular circustances
* helps in medicine
* create better products
* DS = Statistics + Computer Science

### Concept 02: Projects

#### Projects
Learn by doing, all projects need to be done programming so experience by doing can have good effect on the long term memory.


#### Portafolio projects:

There will be 3 projects, each one of them especializes in a subject so depending on the project the experience will be more pleasable.  First the code will be written in a _jupyter notebook_ to makesure the trainning implementation works, then the code will moved to a python application from the command line.

* Project 1: Find Donors for CharityML with Kaggle (Supervised Machine Learning)
* Project 2: Create an Image Classifier (Deep Learning)
* Project 3: Creating Customer Segments with Arvato (Unsupervised Machine Learning)

#### How the DS Projects work

* Find data that is relevant to the interest
* include all needed information
* analyze the atributes and match them with the database
* create smart ways to present them
* find out what things are related with others
* data is always measy, spend a fair amount of time cleaning it
* participate in real world projects
