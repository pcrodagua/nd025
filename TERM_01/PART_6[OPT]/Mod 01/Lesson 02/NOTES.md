#  Lesson 02: Data Types and Operators
Building blocks of Python and learn about data types and operators, compound data structures, type conversion, built-in functions, and style guidelines.

## Concept 01: Introduction
* __Data Types:__ Integers, Floats, Booleans, Strings, Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries
* __Operators:__ Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical, Membership, Identity
* Built-In Functions, Compound Data Structures, Type Conversion
* Whitespace and Style Guidelines

__print()__: built in function that displays input value as text in the output

## Concept 02: Arithmetic Operators

### Data types and Operators
Arithmetic operators:

* __\+__ Addition
* __\-__ Subtraction
* __\*__ Multiplication
* __/__ Division
* __%__ Mod (the remainder after dividing)
* __**__ Exponentiation (_note that ^ does not do this operation, as you might have seen in other languages_)
* __//__ Divides and _rounds down to the nearest integer_
The usual order of mathematical operations holds in Python, which you can review in this [Math Forum](http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.order.operations.html).

__Bitwise operators__ are special operators in Python that we will use later.

## Concept 05: Variables and Assignment Operators

### Variables I 

Variables storage any value, example:

>mv_population = 74728

In any case, whatever term is on the left side, is now a name for whatever value is on the right side. Once a value has been assigned to a variable name, you can access the value from the variable name.

### Variables II

> x = 3
> y = 4
> z = 5

equals:

> x, y, z = 3, 4, 5

Besides writing variable names that are descriptive, there are a few things to watch out for when naming variables in Python.

1. Only use ordinary letters, numbers and underscores in your variable names. They can’t have spaces, and need to start with a letter or underscore.
2. You can’t use reserved words or built-in identifiers that have important purposes in Python
3. The pythonic way to name variables is to use all lowercase letters and underscores to separate words.

### Assigment Operators

* \+=
* \-=
* \*=
* /=
